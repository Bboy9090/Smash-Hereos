also we have to take        into consideration that the characters are not mine to use freely all except kaixon & jaxson 3tails The integrity of the lore demands that this is your saga, not just borrowed aesthetics. For a Grade-A blueprint, we build a Grade-A IP foundation.

We are renaming the entire core roster right now. This is the Codex Renaming Matrix that makes this game legally distinct while keeping the spirit, stats, and role intact.

This is the start of the "Super Smash Bros Grand Saga by Bobby Me" IP.

📘 Codex Renaming Matrix: Core 15 Heroes ⚔️
We're shifting focus from the original names to the core function and power tier of each character, maintaining the provided stat scaling from your Matrix.

Original Name	New Character Name (Saga IP)	Core Archetype & Role	Key B-Move Renaming Focus
Mario	The Radiant Jumper (Aura Jumper)	Main Protagonist; Heroic Anchor	Focus on Flow and Impact (e.g., Radiant Uppercut).
Luigi	The Phantom Heart	Heart-core Support; Poltergeist Specialist	Focus on S-ATK and Support (e.g., Heart-Core Vacuum).
Sonic	The Cobalt Blur	Speed God; Momentum Specialist	Focus on Velocity and Spin (e.g., Tainted Momentum Drive).
Shadow	Obsidian Echo	Oblivion Tier; Hyper-Aura Wielder	Focus on Chaos and Teleportation (e.g., Chaos Flicker Strike).
Link	The Hylian Knight	Versatile Divine Knight; Relic Master	Focus on Arcane Utility and Blade (e.g., Spirit Draw Arrow).
Samus	The Chozo Hunter	Tech Powerhouse; Chozo-enhanced Warrior	Focus on Charge and Weapon Systems (e.g., Overcharge Cannon).
Pikachu	Volt Deity (Spark)	Emotional Lightning Deity; Thunder God	Focus on Elemental Status and Speed (e.g., Static Field Rush).
Kirby	The Star Shaper	Cosmic Mimic Demigod; Unpredictable Supremacy	Focus on Absorption and Replication (e.g., Cosmic Clone).
Peach	Harmonarch Queen	Harmonarch Bearer; Healer / Light Ascendant	Focus on Healing and Supportive light (e.g., Lightwave Shield).
Zelda	Prismatic Strategist	Arcane Tactician; Divine Spellwork	Focus on Aura Traps and Arcane defense (e.g., Aura Bind Trap).
Rosalina	Stellar Matron	Cosmic Architect; Starlight Deity	Focus on Gravitation and Star manipulation (e.g., Gravity Well Blast).
Fox McCloud	Wing Commander Vox	Predator Wing Leader; Precision Fighter	Focus on Reflex and Tech (e.g., Apex Laser Strike).
Mega Man X	Adaptation Unit X	Tech Front Anchor; Adaptation Master	Focus on Weapon Replication and System Overload (e.g., Adaptive Overdrive).
Donkey Kong	Primal Juggernaut	Apex Brute; Emotional Guardian	Focus on Mass and Force (e.g., Earthquake Punch).
Kai-Xon Jax-Son	The Tri-Aura Echoes	Hyper Fusion Prodigy; Twin Ascendant	Focus on Instinct and Echoing (e.g., Tri-Aura Step).

Export to Sheets

This locks in the IP. We're fighting Shadow Blurs and trying to snag the Chozo Hunter, not just a collection of copyrighted sprites.

Now that the roster is secured, we can proceed with the next critical piece of the blueprint, which is designing the Enemy AI and the final Oblivion's End Cinematic Sequences.

okay great final then shape out the rest of the misssions fro,m begining to the end hich would be done now
You said:
10 missions each complete with bosses cinematics and game ready structure each bosss level should play like every video game boss how theres tiers of difficulty patterns and exploits and we should have easy medium hard 3 tiers of dfficulty for the gamer to choose from at the begining of gameplay and auto sasve checkpoiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiints after each mission and halfway through each mission and every character who is playable should be extremelly relatable to the lore we are emmulating the kids or gamers should immediately know who mario sonic kirby are by their look moves and special bu to stay safe from copyrights we must change the minumum of what we can in order ttttttto stay safe both ways from the copyrights and the fans eyes

would we get introuble for putting in parenthesis mario eqiuvlant?
You said:

You said:
this seeems like  second levels like the game will start we willl walk a few steps and jump twice slap the villlains  4 times and mission ovvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvver might need to exapnd on it maybe gget a few levels to play like the orignals lore like one msiion can play out like mario world mission another sonic greenhill level sonci gmeplay kriby link zelda star fox megaman etc...
You said:
c and it doesnt have to be every mission from b1 to b9 but a good mix of it yes and the ones we dont use the lore mchanics we can use our own original mechincs 
You said:
loooks good but the triaura can be named Kai-Jax the 3tailed fusion of all the friends of other characters tttttttttttttttttthat may have fallen victim to the void his tails are from sonics friend tails his gloves are from knuckles his speed from shadow his colors and looks from humanooid to muscular tall to agile and slender and we cant forget the items like mushrooms to expand size rings for speed firebslls ice balls raccon suits stars invincibility and others i may be forgetting maybe we can see our heroes use a few items throughout thr game maybe thy are a big help maybe we create grrrrrreat syper or grand stars for the end wish to wish back alll of theheros frinds back in an emotional end which would potentially seee kaijax utimately erased and since he was a big part of the game and the fight against voidonus it will be a laege pi;lll to swllow but very emotional to finally seee everyone reunite or in the end they cn choose the workd and universe to b efixxed and complete again and keeep kaijax as who he is and just see him for the person they remember nad let him liv on with them in side

wow i forgot about silver the hegdehog and his impact in our books because kaijax was orignally createed now for the games but i have been writing these books for a year now and have over 100 iterations of the 9 bookssss so any way b3 we seen palunteena and roselina create 2 life forms who were to be the fail safe options to sav the world should they all falter there in that moment which we see they end up winning anyway and the 2 stars in the sky are created anyway nonetheless so silver and lunara which in a way mirror the palunteena guardiannnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn and warrior concept for the lore and silver being who he is able to time travel and goes back to save his mother from dying which keeps himalive and maybe we tie something like this to kaijax

best anwer would be 
You said:
5  but aalso want to branchoff what you said here about the connection between: Time-based hero (Silver) Memory-based hero (Kai-Jax),Harmony-based hero (Lunara)…creatingg unlimited storytelling options:A sequel where Kai-Jax has to enter someone’s memories,A spin-off where Silver tries to prevent a future crisis
,A movie where Lunara anchors the Weave against a new threat and how we are building an IP wheel, not just a story. so what if between our actual story mode we see or get to play as one of the 3 special heroes during their own codex missions in paralel to our heroes story since silverrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr can time travel and kaijax can memory travel and lunara can harmonize through oor with them both if not just silver that means technically they always havebeen allwas can be always will be like from book 1 even beyond book 9 the possiblities are endless but lets say for our game we weave in a few side bonus specialized missions where we get to live through one of our special characters and a super secret misssion that only thy knew about since it mmmmmmmmmay have happen before after or durin the story
