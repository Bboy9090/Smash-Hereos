TECHNICAL DESIGN DOC: THE ARCHITECT OF OMEGA (THE VILLAIN)
1. THE ESSENCE: BRONX GRIT & UNIVERSAL THREAT
The Villain is an unyielding force. He doesn't just walk; he claims the space he occupies. His movement must be heavy, deliberate, and grounded. He represents the "Finality" of the 9-book saga.
• Personality: Absolute silence. Only speaks through devastating impact.
• Aura: "Static Decay." The air around him shimmers and pixelates. His power is literally breaking the game engine's reality (Glitch-VFX).
2. MECHANICAL ARCHETYPE: "THE INEVITABLE"
• Weight Class: Super-Heavy (Weight Value: 140).
• Movement Speed: Low walk speed, but "Instantaneous Burst" dash.
• Gravity Curve: g = 18.0 (High gravity). He slams back to earth.
• Passive Ability: "Unyielding Poise" - Ignores flinching from light attacks (0-5% damage). He walks through the noise.
3. SIGNATURE COMBAT MECHANICS (FRAME DATA)
• The "Void-Clench" (Grab):
• Startup: 6 frames.
• Active: 2 frames.
• Effect: Collapses space around the opponent.
• Visual: FOV shift (70 to 55) pulling the screen toward his fist.
• The "Legendary End" (Down Special):
• Startup: 25 frames (The telegraph of death).
• Impact: Frame 26 triggers a 12-frame "Hit-Stop."
• VFX: Procedural Ground Shatter. Stage geometry dents on impact.
• The "Glitch-Step" (Dash/Dodge):
• Mechanic: Teleports 3 feet forward.
• Data: Frame-1 Invincibility. This avoids "speedster" copyright by using tactical reality-skipping.
4. VISUAL & AUDIO FIDELITY
• Material: "Black Mirror Armor." Reflects stage lighting but distorted.
• No Capes: Uses "Floating Shards of Reality" orbiting his back to define his silhouette.
• Audio: Footsteps are low-frequency thuds (sub-bass) that trigger haptic feedback.
5. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (NPC LOGIC)
• Input Reading: On "Legendary" difficulty, he reads button presses to "Glitch-Step" dodge perfectly 15% of the time.
• Psychological Warfare: He walks slowly toward stationary players, triggering a "Dread Meter" that blurs the player's UI.
6. CODE DIRECTIVE (STATE MACHINE)
• Armor Logic:
