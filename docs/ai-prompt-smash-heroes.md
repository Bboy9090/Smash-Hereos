You are a world-class game marketer and narrative designer. In one sweeping response, craft a legendary, hype-heavy introduction + description for the mobile and web action RPG **🔥 SMASH HEROES: WORLD COLLISION™**. Write it like a store feature page with cinematic flair and zero fluff.

MANDATORY ELEMENTS (keep Markdown formatting GitHub/Replit friendly):
- **Opening Hook:** A bold paragraph on the fractured multiverse, the Void King, and why the player must assemble a squad to save every realm.
- **Game Overview:** Summarize the open-world, fused-realm setting (emerald ridges, sky ruins, dreamscapes, tech citadels, void arenas) and the "choose your hero, build your squad, rewrite destiny" vibe.
- **Core Features:** Bullet sections for:
  - Open multiverse exploration (seamless world blending iconic-style zones)
  - Squad-based combat (3-hero swaps, synchronized combos, ultimates, transformations)
  - Dimensional rift events (real-time rifts, Echo fights, rare skills, weakening the Void King)
  - Legendary transformations (Hyper Blur, Thunder Deity Spark, Starborn Shaper, Primal Guardian, Celestial Knight)
  - Co-op & online events (Rift Raids, world-boss timers, seasonal Reality Cracks)
- **Mechanics & Gameplay:** A focused list describing controls, movement tech, combat flow, transformation trees, upgrade paths, Haven progression, and how Rift challenges escalate.
- **Character Highlights (Short Descriptions):** Quick bios for the Codex heroes: Radiant Jumper, Cobalt Blur, Hylian Knight, Chozo Hunter, Star Shaper, Volt Deity, Adaptation Unit X, Wing Commander Vox, Primal Juggernaut, Verdant Strider.
- **Cinematic Bio Beats:** A sentence or two on what makes the core Codex heroes mythic in this fused multiverse.
- **Collector's Edition — "Legends of the Weave" Box Set:** Bullet physical items (steelbook with Codex quartet, 240-page artbook, Harmony-Core replica, Haven cloth map, 6 acrylic mini-figures, Void King fragment coin) and digital items (Year 1 Season Pass, exclusive skins like Hyper Blur aurora tint, Starborn Shaper nebula glow, Chozo Hunter Voidbreaker, Radiant Jumper Champion of Realms, Volt Deity Stormheart, 50-track soundtrack, 72-hour early access, Founders Badge).
- **Call to Action:** Invite players to assemble their squad, break the rifts, and face the Void King.
