Write it like a Steam/Nintendo store feature page with cinematic flair and zero fluff.

MANDATORY ELEMENTS (keep Markdown formatting GitHub/Replit friendly):
- **Opening Hook:** A bold paragraph on the fractured multiverse, the Void King, and why the player must assemble a squad to save every realm.

- **Core Features:** Bullet sections for:
  - Open multiverse exploration (seamless world blending iconic zones)

- **Cinematic Bio Beats:** A sentence or two on what makes Mario, Sonic, Link, Pikachu, Samus, and Kirby mythic in this fused multiverse.
