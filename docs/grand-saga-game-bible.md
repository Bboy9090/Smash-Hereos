# Super Smash Grand Saga — Game Bible (Codex Edition)

A condensed, IP-safe design bible for the browser-first build. All character names use the Codex roster; no legacy franchise names appear here.

## Core Backbone
1. Choose a four-hero squad.
2. Stream a sector (tutorial, open zone, or boss) instead of one giant map.
3. Fight → Objective → Fire Moment → Boss.
4. Unlock upgrades, transformations, and synergy perks.
5. Cinematic close → next mission.

### Act I early mission seeds
- **M1 — Grand Arena: First Light:** Tutorial crowd fight; learn controls, defeat a Rift Champion, sky flickers. See `docs/book1-mission1-mvp.md`.
- **M2 — Qualifier Brackets: Cracks in the Spotlight:** Mixed melee/ranged elites and first minor Void glitch while protecting the arena core.
- **M3 — Broken Bracket: Rift on Live Broadcast:** Fake bracket match collapses on-camera; arena floor glitches, a Rift Beast charges through, and the match becomes a survival boss fight. See `docs/book1-mission3-broken-bracket.md`.

### Cinematic Mission Beats (13–20)
- **M13 – Inside the Rift Wanderer:** Eclipse Swordsman and Vexryn navigate a shifting dimensional labyrinth of mirror clones; parry-timed strikes break the Void Specter’s slow-time traps before the rift collapses around them.
- **M14 – Wild Tribe Prophecy:** Verdant Strider reaches a hidden jungle tribe, defends the princess against the Prophesied Devourer, and crowns the tribe’s new protector by cracking the beast’s shell with elemental eggs.
- **M15 – Training the Fire Prince:** Solaro’s Nexus gauntlet drills power-up management; a Fire Goliath falls once he chains Flame Core orbs, Skyclaw glides, and a Grand-Star-style finisher under Radiant Jumper’s eye.
- **M16 – The Weave Cracks:** Silver and Lunara hold a collapsing Weave pocket, slowing Silence pulses while Harmony bursts expose the Silence Core’s weak points; a fleeting echo of Kai-Jax flickers after the core shatters.
- **M17 – Citadel Awakens:** Radiant Jumper, Cobalt Blur, and Hylian Knight breach a dark spire of the Rift Citadel, dismantling the Void Tower Warden’s shields with speed distractions and synchronized relic/aura strikes.
- **M18 – The Lost Son:** Redlock duels a Dark Seraphim inside a memory-lit cavern, timing parries against time-warp claws and reflecting blasts to pierce the heart that still echoes his missing guardian.
- **M19 – Unraveling of Unity:** Silver, Lunara, and a nascent Kai-Jax stabilize Nexus Haven while the Void King’s final minion rips at time; rewinds and harmony shields open the guard for a finishing strike as the hub quakes.
- **M20 – Collapse of Hope:** The roster marches into the Void Realm for Voidonus Imperion’s preview fight—time fractures, multi-lane loops, and phase-lock rifts precede Radiant Jumper’s aura-led strike that seals the first breach.

## Progression & Rewards
Story clears unlock heroes, transformations, and artifacts; endgame clears grant Saga ultimates; base-building grants passive buffs; synergy milestones unlock team passives.

## Kai-Jax Identity & Item System
- **Kai-Jax:** Codex-born fusion hero created from fallen allies; Memory Travel lets him replay echo styles, walk through memory zones, rewind his own actions briefly, and fuse echoes mid-combat. Silver mentors him to stabilize paradox echoes; Lunara anchors his harmony link.
- **IP-safe items:** Aura Bloom (size/strength), Momentum Rings (speed burst), Flame Core Orb, Frostheart Shard, Skyclaw Mantle (glide/hover), Grand Star (invincibility), Harmonarch Grand Stars (collect seven for the final wish).

## Grand Star Wish Endings (Oblivion’s End)
- **Ending A – Restoration Wish:** Revive every fallen friend and heal the Weave; Kai-Jax fades because his fused-source no longer exists.
- **Ending B – Choose the Future:** Revive everyone and keep Kai-Jax intact as the living symbol of unity; the Weave stabilizes with him as guardian.
Both endings are supported; unlocking the Triad Codex secret mission reveals extra context before the choice.

## Cinematic Trailer Beats (3–5 minutes)
- **Open:** Arena rubble, Radiant Jumper breathing hard; lightning tears sky; Void Emperor descends. Narrator: “When the Weave falls… who rises?”
- **Build:** Cobalt Blur skids in Celestial form; Hylian Knight draws a radiant blade; Chozo Hunter charges a zero-core shot; Volt Deity ascends to Thunder form; crowds fade to Rift howls.
- **Mid:** Tournament collapse; Silver and Lunara awaken; Legacy Kids ignite; Kai-Jax unleashes Hyper 3-Tails; montage of Acts II–VIII battles and Harmonarch judgments.
- **Climax:** All heroes charge across a collapsing multiverse bridge; Void Emperor towers above; Infinite Symphony sting.
- **Title Drop:** SUPER SMASH GRAND SAGA — LEGENDS OF THE WEAVE.
- **Outro CTA:** “Assemble the squad. Break the rifts. Rewrite destiny.”

## Developer Notes
- Stream assets per sector; favor instancing and texture atlases.
- Maintain camera-relative controls and facing rotation; upgrade to Rapier Kinematic Controller when available.
- Define missions, synergies, and rewards in JSON for LiveOps updates; reserve seasonal paths and new heroes.
